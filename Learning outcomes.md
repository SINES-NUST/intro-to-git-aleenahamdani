# **What have I learnt?** 	:woman_technologist:
<br>
Being a student from non-bioinformatics or non-CS background,  starting the semester was tough, especially with basic programming. 
<br>
Learning Python felt like a big challenge at firstâ€” coz its rules and logic were new and confusing. GitHub on the other hand, was another struggle with its technical terms and autograder stuff. 
<br>
Initially, i used to get very depressed because i was failing every single assignment and quiz. Slowly, I started getting the hang of it and programming things somewhat started making sense XD. 
<br>
Although this degree is academically challenging and at times makes me feel dumb, yet the only thing that make me feel satisfied is I am learing new things everyday. Small wins in understanding programming basics and using GitHub make me feel more confident. I'm determined to keep going and get better as the semester goes on.

## **LEARNING UPTIL NOW??** :writing_hand:
![LEARNING??](1.jpg)

In this semester, particularly in this course, i learnt about:
<br>
`a) Pseudocodes and basic python` (its functions, operators, how to call a function, loops, lists, dictionaries,tupples etc)
<br>
`b) Git, Git Hub, Git Hub Copilot.` Especially in Git Hub I learnt about 
<br>
1) creating my profile 
2) understanding and creating new repositories
3) about autograder and its working
4) creating new markdown files(.md) and editing and styling them
5) commit changes, merge and to fork repositories

`c) Installing and using VS Code (also about kernels and extensions)`
<br>
`d) Linux os.`

# **Still confused????** :skull_and_crossbones:	
![CONFUSION???](2.jpg)

I still do not understand properly about the push and pull command. Its a bit confusing specially if you create local repo on pc and then merge changes on git hub website. 
<br>
Umm, and when it comes to the entire course, what i am still confused is, i guess how to code fast or write long codes, lol. Or particularly how to interpret the question in exam and get good grades. XD
